When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When my code base looks good enough with a working version I can use a remote 
repository. When I want to share my code base with other contributors who could 
add more features to it, I can use a remote repository to share my code base 
with them and vice versa.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Using Git to stay up-to-date by pulling changes automatically is a good idea
but it won't be preferred in all cases. 

-> If suppose myself and another contributor 
were making changes to the same file and he pushed in changes to the remote
before I do, it'll result in 'merge conflict' when git automatically try to pull
changes. 

-> If suppose the 'master' branch in remote repository has introduced a bug due 
to a recent commit by some other contributor, and I were in the middle of 
something (say adding a very small feature), then automatic pull introduces bug
in my code as well.
