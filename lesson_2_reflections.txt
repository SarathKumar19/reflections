What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

'git init' is the command to be used to initialize a git repository. When you 
run it, it initializes a empty Git repository without any commits. You should 
add commits to the repository by yourself. Git doesn't do it for you.





How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a place resides in between your working directory and 
repository. It offers great flexibility for us by providing an area where we 
can add whichever files we wish that should go into the repository in the next 
commit we are about to make.





How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

I can compare my changes from my working directory to Staging area as well as from staging area to the repository. By looking at those 2 diffs, I can come to a conclusion whether or not I've one logical change per commit.
