What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

'git init' is the command to be used to initialize a git repository. When you 
run it, it initializes a empty Git repository without any commits. You should 
add commits to the repository by yourself. Git doesn't do it for you.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a place resides in between your working directory and repository. It offers great flexibility for us by providing an area where we can add whichever files we wish that should go into the repository in the next commit we are about to make.
